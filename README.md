🍸 ReelSpirit - AI Powered Instagram Analyzer
ReelSpirit is a comprehensive web application that analyses Instagram content creators' profiles, monitors shared Reels videos using Google Gemini AI, and automatically categorises them based on their content (particularly cocktail and drink recipes).

🎯 Project Objective and Approach
There are thousands of fantastic cocktail and gastronomy posts on Instagram, but finding a specific recipe (such as ‘vodka-based cocktails’) requires watching hundreds of videos one by one.

ReelSpirit was created to solve this problem:

It takes an Instagram profile link from the user.

It extracts the descriptions and metadata from the videos.

It analyses the content using Artificial Intelligence (Gemini).

It determines whether the content is a cocktail recipe and, if so, which base spirit (Whisky, Gin, Tequila, etc.) it contains.

It provides the user with a statistical dashboard and a filterable gallery.

🚀 Features
🔍 Profile Analysis: Can analyse any public Instagram profile (Business/Creator).

🤖 AI-Powered Classification: Intelligently tags videos with Google Gemini integration.

📊 Visual Statistics: A graphical interface showing how many videos are in each category.

⚡ Background Tasks: FastAPI Background Tasks continues to scan large profiles in the background.

🐳 Full Docker Support: Frontend, Backend and Database are up and running with a single command.

📱 Responsive Design: A modern and mobile-friendly interface with Angular Material.

🛠 Technologies Used
Backend
Python & FastAPI: High-performance asynchronous API.

Google Gemini AI: Content analysis and summarisation.

Instagram Graph API: Data retrieval operations.

PostgreSQL & SQLAlchemy: Database and ORM structure.

Pydantic: Data validation.

Frontend
Angular 18+: Modern SPA architecture.

RxJS: Reactive programming and polling mechanisms.

SCSS: Customised styles.

DevOps
Docker & Docker Compose: Containerisation.

Nginx: Frontend server and Reverse Proxy.

⚙️Installation and Execution
To run this project in your local environment, you only need to have Docker and the Docker Desktop application installed on your computer.

1. Clone the Project
git clone https://github.com/kullaniciadiniz/ReelSpirit.git
cd ReelSpirit-Project

2. Configure Environment Variables (Optional Customisation)
Within the project, there is a ready-made .env file in the ReelSpirit-Backend folder. This file contains the default API keys and tokens required for the project to run.

To quickly test the project, you can proceed to the next step without making any changes to this file.

However, if you wish to use the project with your own accounts (your own Instagram Business account or your own Google Gemini quota), you can customise these values as follows:

Open the .env file in the ReelSpirit-Backend folder using any text editor (Notepad, VS Code, etc.).

Replace the following fields with your own values:

# --- Instagram Settings ---
# Enter the ID and Token you obtained from your Facebook Developer portal here
INSTAGRAM_BUSINESS_ID=YOUR_BUSINESS_ID_VALUE
ACCESS_TOKEN=YOUR_FACEBOOK_ACCESS_TOKEN_VALUE

# --- Google AI Settings ---
# Enter the API key you obtained from Google AI Studio here
GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_VALUE

# --- Database Settings (Can remain default for Docker) ---
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:1029@db:5432/ReelSpiritDB
Note: Using your own API keys prevents you from hitting the limits (quotas) of the default keys.

3. Start with a Single Command 🚀
Open the terminal in the root directory (where the docker-compose.yml file is located) and enter the following command:

docker-compose up --build

This process performs the following steps:

It installs the PostgreSQL database.

It creates the backend image and starts the API.

It compiles (builds) the Angular application and serves it with Nginx.

4. Access the Application
Once the installation is complete, go to the following address in your browser:

👉 http://localhost:4200/

For API Documentation (Swagger): 👉 http://localhost:8000/docs
